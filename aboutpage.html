<h2>Author: Amari Pardi </h2>
<p>Bonjour, my name is Amari Pardi (at least that’s what I am on this website anyways). Welcome to my personal catalog of text, images, and opinions. My most popular blog thread follows my adventures in trash registry; where I collect, photograph, and explain the life and death of my everyday items. <br>
  A bit about me, I enjoy playing video games, I find stuffed animals comforting, I love to eat dark chocolate at night, and I always drink coffee in the morning. I have a scrapbook journal, I like to buy things for my loved ones, and I have a small dislike for people with absurd phobias. I guess an important thing to know amour me is that I am fond of the tangents taken in life fueled by passion. I am often inspired by art, movies, books, people, and music to do random projects passionately. Or at least that is something I try to center my life around; passion for the things I do. Also my favorite color is pink. <br>
  <br>

<h3>Trash Familiar</h3>
<img src="images/DSCN1894.JPG" alt="unused chair" width="300">
<p>This chair serves as a trash familiar on the porch of my home. Seemingly it is not trash, it looks like a regular old chair, to some perhaps dingy. However it serves no use (at least <i>I </i> have never seen it be used), and therefore is sorta like trash. However the moment someones bum touches its dusty seat, it ascends from <b><em>Trash Familiar</em></b> to <b><em>Familiar that is kinda Trashy </em></b> </p>
